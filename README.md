## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an interactive **Covid-19 Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**.

The dashboard visualizes key Covid-19 metrics across multiple countries to help users understand:

- Total Covid-19 cases and new cases by country
- Total deaths by country
- New cases trends over time
- Case fatality rates by country
- New deaths by year and country
- The impact of median age on Covid-19 spread

This project demonstrates how data visualization can transform complex pandemic data into clear, actionable insights.
